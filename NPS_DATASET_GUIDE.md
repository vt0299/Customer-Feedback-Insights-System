## How to Use This Dataset

### 1. Data Ingestion

To use this dataset with your existing pipeline, simply update your data ingestion script to point to the new file:

```python
# In your ingestion script
feedback_file = 'data/nps_feedback_dataset.csv'

# The dataset is already in the correct format for your pipeline
# with columns: feedback_id, customer_id, timestamp, rating, feedback_text, category
```

### 2. Running the Complete Pipeline

You can now run the complete feedback analysis pipeline:

```bash
# Run the full pipeline
python run_pipeline.py

# Or run individual components
python -m src.ingestor.ingest_feedback
python -m src.embedder.generate_embeddings
python -m src.clusterer.cluster_feedback
python -m src.topic_labeler.label_topics
python -m src.analysis.trend_detection
python -m src.analysis.cohort_analysis
```

### 3. Dashboard Analysis

Start the Streamlit dashboard to explore the data:

```bash
python run_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will show:
- **Overview**: Key metrics and NPS score trends
- **Topic Analysis**: Clustering and topic insights
- **Trend Analysis**: Growing/declining topics and NPS changes
- **Cohort Analysis**: Customer behavior by signup cohorts
- **RAG Q&A**: Ask questions about the feedback data

## Dataset Advantages

- Includes realistic rating distribution across 0-10 scale
- Accounts for customer lifecycle and product evolution

### 2. Rich Metadata
- **Premium vs Regular**: Analyze differences between customer tiers
- **Spam Detection**: Filter out low-quality feedback
- **Temporal Data**: Track changes over time
- **Customer Journey**: Link feedback to signup dates

### 3. Synthetic Feedback Text

- Realistic language patterns for each NPS category
- Consistent with rating scores
- Includes premium-specific feedback nuances

### 4. Comprehensive Categories
- Product Quality, Customer Service, Features, Value
- Technical Issues, Support, Performance, Pricing
- Premium-specific categories for enhanced analysis

## Analysis Opportunities

### 1. NPS Trend Analysis
- Track NPS changes over time
- Identify seasonal patterns
- Correlate with product releases or events

### 2. Cohort Analysis
- Compare customer behavior by signup month
- Analyze retention and satisfaction patterns
- Identify successful onboarding periods

### 3. Premium vs Regular Analysis
- Compare satisfaction levels between tiers
- Analyze premium feature impact
- Identify upselling opportunities

### 4. Topic Evolution
- Track how feedback topics change over time
- Identify emerging issues or successes
- Monitor product improvement impact

### 5. Predictive Analytics

- Identify at-risk premium customers
- Forecast NPS trends

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Large sample size (1.5M+ records)
- Realistic temporal distribution
- Balanced representation of customer types
- Consistent data format

### Considerations
- Feedback text is synthetic (generated based on ratings)
- Categories are algorithmically assigned
- Spam accounts always give 0 ratings
- Premium customers tend to give slightly higher scores

## Next Steps

1. **Run Initial Analysis**: Use the existing pipeline to process this dataset
2. **Explore Dashboard**: Review all sections for insights
3. **Customize Categories**: Modify category generation if needed
4. **Add Real Data**: Replace with actual customer feedback when available
5. **Extend Analysis**: Add new analysis modules based on insights

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the dataset:
1. Check the data format matches your pipeline expectations
2. Verify all required columns are present
3. Review the processing script: `scripts/prepare_nps_dataset.py`
4. Regenerate the dataset if needed with different parameters
